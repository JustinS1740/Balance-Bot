# Marvel Rivals Balance Bot ü§ñ

A Discord bot that automatically announces new **balance patch posts** from the [Marvel Rivals](https://www.marvelrivals.com/balancepost/) website. The bot is designed to run periodically, check for updates, and notify a designated channel only when a new patch is released.

## üìå Project Purpose

I built this bot to automate the process of tracking balance changes in *Marvel Rivals*, a game I actively follow. Rather than manually checking the website for updates (which can happen unpredictably every few weeks or months), the bot monitors the official site and posts an announcement directly in my personal Discord server.

This bot serves as a **useful alert system** for my gaming group and a **learning project** for building bots and web scrapers with Python.

- ‚úÖ **Async programming** with `asyncio` and `discord.py`
- ‚úÖ **HTML parsing** to extract dynamic content from websites
- ‚úÖ **Environment variable handling** using `python-dotenv` for sensitive data like bot tokens
- ‚úÖ **Deploying bots** on mini server infrastructure like Raspberry Pi for 24/7 uptime
- ‚úÖ **Debugging real-world issues** like selector mismatches, HTML changes, and bot hosting
